        Using NLP in Disaster Response
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In this blog, we’ll apply the ETL, NLP, and ML pipeline to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.
This is one of the most critical problems in data science and machine learning. During a disaster, we get millions and millions of messages either directly or via social media. We’ll probably see 1 in 1000 relevant messages. A few critical words like water, blocked roads, and medical supplies are used during a disaster response.

        End-to-End Machine Learning Project with Deployment Part 1: Project Set-Up
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Many of us often make the mistake of jumping straight into coding when working on end-to-end projects. This approach can work well when dealing with small datasets that don’t need much preprocessing. In these cases, we can quickly train a predictive machine learning model and deploy it in the cloud. But this approach has its limitations. If the project is not set up correctly, the code may not be “reusable” or “scalable”, which can cause problems down the road.

      PROJECT REPORT: DISASTER RESPONSE PROJECT Web Interface CONCEPT
The goal of the Disaster-Response-Pipeline project was to develop a machine learning pipeline that could accurately categorize emergency messages received during a disaster event. The objective was to create an automated system that could quickly identify and classify relevant messages, enabling emergency responders to prioritize and respond effectively to different types of emergencies.
DATA
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Figure Eight, now Appen, and consisted of labeled text messages related to various disaster scenarios.

      Natural Language Processing (NLP): I leverage NLP techniques to analyze and understand textual data, enabling automation, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, and more.
NLP Concepts: In my work with NLP, I apply a variety of concepts and techniques, including:
Tokenization: Breaking text into smaller units, such as words or sentences, for analysis. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities, such as people, organizations, and locations. Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS): Assigning grammatical tags to words, such as noun, verb, or adjective.

      PROJECT REPORT: FINGERPRINT VERIFICATION SYSTEM Led a team of six data scientists and engineers to design and implement a highly secure biometric user authentication system using Neural Fuzzy Extractor (NFE) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), achieving a marginal improvement in the equal error rate (EER) from 5.75% to 5.82%, while ensuring minimal loss of FVC2006 fingerprint data. Enhanced the precision of the fingerprint data by formulating a robust deep learning algorithm, specifically a Siamese Network with a triplet loss function, resulting in an Area Under Curve (AUC) score of 0.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      What is biometric authentication? Biometric authentication is a mode of verifying a user based on some part of their physical features. Authentication is different from identification, where biometrics such as fingerprint, face, retina scan, etc. are used to identify a person. In authentication, biometrics are used to verify if a user is what they are claiming to be.
Importance of biometric authenticator This is one of the most popular forms of security when it comes to digital identity.
