      <title>Using NLP in Disaster Response</title>

      <description>In this blog, we’ll apply the ETL, NLP, and ML pipeline to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.
This is one of the most critical problems in data science and machine learning. During a disaster, we get millions and millions of messages either directly or via social media. We’ll probably see 1 in 1000 relevant messages. A few critical words like water, blocked roads, and medical supplies are used during a disaster response.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Machine Learning Project with Deployment Part 1: Project Set-Up</title>

      <description>Many of us often make the mistake of jumping straight into coding when working on end-to-end projects. This approach can work well when dealing with small datasets that don’t need much preprocessing. In these cases, we can quickly train a predictive machine learning model and deploy it in the cloud. But this approach has its limitations. If the project is not set up correctly, the code may not be “reusable” or “scalable”, which can cause problems down the road.</description>

      <description>PROJECT REPORT: DISASTER RESPONSE PROJECT Web Interface CONCEPT
The goal of the Disaster-Response-Pipeline project was to develop a machine learning pipeline that could accurately categorize emergency messages received during a disaster event. The objective was to create an automated system that could quickly identify and classify relevant messages, enabling emergency responders to prioritize and respond effectively to different types of emergencies.
DATA
The dataset used for this project was obtained from Figure Eight, now Appen, and consisted of labeled text messages related to various disaster scenarios.</description>

      <description>PROJECT REPORT: CUSTOMER SPENDING PROJECTIONS AT STARBUCKS CONCEPT
The Customer Spending Projections at Starbucks project aimed to analyze Starbucks&amp;rsquo; sales data to understand customer spending patterns and provide insights for offering personalized coupons and recommendations. The project leveraged a dataset consisting of customer profiles, promotional offers, and transaction logs to gain insights into purchase decisions and offer influence.
DATASET OVERVIEW
The dataset comprised three files: profile.json, portfolio.json, and transcript.json. The profile file contained information about rewards program users, including gender, age, income, and membership details.</description>

      <description>In Part 2 I will try to address two remaining questions:
How to recommend coupons/offers to current customers based on their spending pattern? How to recommend coupons/offers to new customers? I will show you how to build a recommendation system to recommend ideal users for each offer.
In other words, my goal is to recommend the best offers to the existing users. In this system, we select an existing offer and recommend top n users for that offer.</description>
