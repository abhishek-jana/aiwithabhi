      <title>Using NLP in Disaster Response</title>

      <description>In this blog, we’ll apply the ETL, NLP, and ML pipeline to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.
This is one of the most critical problems in data science and machine learning. During a disaster, we get millions and millions of messages either directly or via social media. We’ll probably see 1 in 1000 relevant messages. A few critical words like water, blocked roads, and medical supplies are used during a disaster response.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Machine Learning Project with Deployment Part 1: Project Set-Up</title>

      <description>Many of us often make the mistake of jumping straight into coding when working on end-to-end projects. This approach can work well when dealing with small datasets that don’t need much preprocessing. In these cases, we can quickly train a predictive machine learning model and deploy it in the cloud. But this approach has its limitations. If the project is not set up correctly, the code may not be “reusable” or “scalable”, which can cause problems down the road.</description>

      <description>Boston is located on the east coast of the US, whereas Seattle is located on the west coast. If we compare the weathers, this is what we see:
Boston, Massachusetts
Summer High: the July high is around 82.4 degrees Winter Low: the January low is 19.2 Rain: averages 47.4 inches of rain a year Snow: averages 48.1 inches of snow a year Seattle, Washington
Summer High: the July high is around 75.</description>

      <title>Starbucks Sales Analysis - Part 1</title>
      <link>https://abhishek-jana.github.io/aiwithabhi/blogs/blog-6/</link>

      <description>Every data tells a story! In this blog I analyzed the Starbucks ’ sales data.
Dataset Overview The data was created to get an overview of the following things:
To observe the purchase decision of people based on different promotional offers. There are three types of offers: BOGO ( buy one get one ), discount, and informational. I wanted to see the influence of these offers on purchases. Finally, I wanted to see how the offers influence a particular group of people.</description>

      <title>Starbucks Sales Analysis - Part 2</title>
      <link>https://abhishek-jana.github.io/aiwithabhi/blogs/blog-3/</link>

      <guid>https://abhishek-jana.github.io/aiwithabhi/blogs/blog-3/</guid>
      <description>In Part 2 I will try to address two remaining questions:
How to recommend coupons/offers to current customers based on their spending pattern? How to recommend coupons/offers to new customers? I will show you how to build a recommendation system to recommend ideal users for each offer.
In other words, my goal is to recommend the best offers to the existing users. In this system, we select an existing offer and recommend top n users for that offer.</description>
