      <description>In this blog, we’ll apply the ETL, NLP, and ML pipeline to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.
This is one of the most critical problems in data science and machine learning. During a disaster, we get millions and millions of messages either directly or via social media. We’ll probably see 1 in 1000 relevant messages. A few critical words like water, blocked roads, and medical supplies are used during a disaster response.</description>

      <description>Natural Language Processing (NLP): I leverage NLP techniques to analyze and understand textual data, enabling automation, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, and more.
NLP Concepts: In my work with NLP, I apply a variety of concepts and techniques, including:
Tokenization: Breaking text into smaller units, such as words or sentences, for analysis. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying named entities, such as people, organizations, and locations. Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS): Assigning grammatical tags to words, such as noun, verb, or adjective.</description>
