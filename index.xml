Abstract: We investigate the possibility of modeling various measures of small-scale galaxy clustering with machine learning methods to constrain parameters of the halo occupation distribution (HOD) model. Using ML techniques results in faster Markov Chain Monte Carlo convergence (within minutes). We find that great care must be taken when using machine learning algorithms in this regime.</description>

      <description>In this blog, we’ll apply the ETL, NLP, and ML pipeline to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.
This is one of the most critical problems in data science and machine learning. During a disaster, we get millions and millions of messages either directly or via social media. We’ll probably see 1 in 1000 relevant messages. A few critical words like water, blocked roads, and medical supplies are used during a disaster response.</description>

      <description>Many of us often make the mistake of jumping straight into coding when working on end-to-end projects. This approach can work well when dealing with small datasets that don’t need much preprocessing. In these cases, we can quickly train a predictive machine learning model and deploy it in the cloud. But this approach has its limitations. If the project is not set up correctly, the code may not be “reusable” or “scalable”, which can cause problems down the road.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a secure way to handle user-specific information involved with the use of artificial neural networks for biometric authentication. Our proposed architecture, called a Neural Fuzzy Extractor (NFE), allows the coupling of pre-existing classifiers with fuzzy extractors, through an artificial-neuralnetwork-based buffer called an expander, with minimal or no performance degradation.</description>

      <description>What is biometric authentication? Biometric authentication is a mode of verifying a user based on some part of their physical features. Authentication is different from identification, where biometrics such as fingerprint, face, retina scan, etc. are used to identify a person. In authentication, biometrics are used to verify if a user is what they are claiming to be.
Importance of biometric authenticator This is one of the most popular forms of security when it comes to digital identity.</description>
